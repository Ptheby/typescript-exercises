# typescript-exercises
 Task from Epic 2 Due 9/25/23
I found typescript so far to be pretty easy in realation to what we have already learned with JS. The parts of the exercise that i have the most trouble with have nothing to do with typescript per se but just genereral concepts. Like on exercise 5 with classes/constructor/proeprties/methods and where everything goes and the proper syntax of it all. So not so much conceptual problems but syntax and how it is written.

It took me way longer than it should have setting up typescript even watching several tutorials. The problem ended up being I just need to restart my Visual Studio Code for it to be emplemented in there.
